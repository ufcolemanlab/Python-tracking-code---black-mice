# Python-tracking-code---black-mice

Code used by the Coleman lab for tracking mice (black/dark mice on a white/light background = BW).  

Video files are required; we used files generated by a Raspberry Pi camera.  

Test/example files (*.mp4 and *.h264) files are included in the directory.  

Use the following scripts together:  
selectROIbw_4.py - Set field bounds and object to track; run first to select field corners and subject (mouse)  
batch_trackBW_vet_1.py - Vet the ROIs; run second to verify all mice are being tracked  
batch_trackBW_4.py - Generates the data; run this script once tracking ROIs are validated, set and working
