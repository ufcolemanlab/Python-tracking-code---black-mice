# Python-tracking-code---black-mice

Code used by the Coleman lab for tracking mice in video files (black/dark mice on a white/light background = BW).  

We use files generated by a Raspberry Pi camera (*.h264 files).  

Test/example files (*.mp4 and *.h264) files are included in the directory.  

Use the following scripts together:  
batch_bw_selectROI.py - Set field bounds and object to track; run first to select field corners and subject (mouse)  
batch_bw_vetTracking.py - Vet the ROIs; run second to verify all mice are being tracked  
batch_bw_getData.py - Generates the data; run this script once tracking ROIs are validated, set and working
getFrame.py - Used to generate 5 images - middle image is stimulus onset/offset frame based on data in MAT file, flanking images are 2 after and 2 before (use getFrame.
